## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Context Management
*   **Summary Buffer Memory**: Keeps the most recent 5-10 turns of dialogue verbatim while summarizing older interactions. This ensures a seamless narrative flow without losing context, even in long-running stories.

### 📝 Character Sheet System
*   **System Prompt Optimization**: Effectively embeds static character data (personality, appearance, background) into the system prompt, ensuring unwavering **Character Consistency** throughout the story.

### 📚 RAG-based Memory
*   **Vector DB (Supabase pgvector)**: Retrieves only the **most relevant information** from vast world settings or past events using vector search. This significantly reduces token costs while maintaining deep and context-aware interactions.

### ⚡ Prompt Compression
*   **Efficiency First**: Maximizes token efficiency by removing unnecessary fluff and using keyword-centric prompt engineering optimized for LLM comprehension.

### 🎨 Scene Visualization
*   **Automatic Image Generation**: Analyzes the narrative text in real-time to calculate **'Emotion Scores' and 'Importance Scores'**. Stable Diffusion is triggered only during pivotal moments with high scores to automatically generate dramatic illustrations.
